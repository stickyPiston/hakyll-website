Hi, I'm Job! I'm a computer science student from the Netherlands,
and currently pursuing a master's degree at Utrecht University.

Most of my programming projects can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/stickyPiston).
You can find:

- various attempts at creating programming languages,
  including a recreation of David Christiansen's [pie](https://thelittletyper.com/),
  and an object-oriented language in the works called [dabulang](https://github.com/stickyPiston/dabulang);
- a few bad attempts at recreating simple games like breakout and asteroids;
- contributions to the code base for the computer science study association
  in Utrecht, [Sticky](https://github.com/svsticky). Of course, Sticky has a
  lot of self-built infrastructure that members
  maintain to keep the association running.

I also listen to a lot of music. My current obsessions are [laura les](https://soundcloud.com/osno1),
[Gezebelle Gaburgably](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2dAr2VXRbboq3vymg20Jtw?si=yrnIjf_eQ0KRknzG6hH7cw),
[Cavetown](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2hR4h1Cao2ueuI7Cx9c7V8?si=J7yly11lTk6F28SlsohZ6Q)
and [The Home Team](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0hp58JplihFjlLstUbKS0x?si=Pe7uwXuCReeISIEqMWWt7g).

From time to time, I like to write a little article about stuff I find interesting
and worth sharing. These can be found in the [archive](/archive.html).
Just to give you an idea on what they're about, here's the latest few posts:
